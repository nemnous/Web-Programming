To model such situations, we use abstract mathematical objects called graphs.</li><li> In this course, we examine basic properties of graphs in detail, setting the stage for us to study a variety of algorithms that are useful for answering questions of the type just posed.</li><li> We communicate by exchanging strings of characters.</li><li> Accordingly, numerous important and familiar applications are based on processing strings.</li><li> We consider classic algorithms for addressing the underlying computational challenges surrounding applications</li></div>
